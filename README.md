# Netflix-Clone

I created a netflix clone with redux thunk. Unlike regular redux, I used the thunk library to perform API requests in actions. I used bootstrap for the design. 
I used Skeleton Loading as the loading component and the split slide structure to list the movies. I also implemented the movie videos coming from the API into my project with React player.
